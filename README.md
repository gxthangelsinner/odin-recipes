# odin-recipes
Odin recipes project. Instructed to create a website with the homepage carrying links to webpages in the site that each hold a different recipe.

Through this project I was able to demonstrate my html skills to create a simple boilerplate, create headers with varying size, create links to other pages, aswell as lists of both kinds unordered and ordered lists, add images to the pages.
