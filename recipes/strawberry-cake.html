    <p><strong>Best Ever Strawberry Cake</strong></p>
    <p>This type of strawberry cake recipe with all-natural strawberry flavoring (no gelatin) is quite rare and difficult to find. This strawberry cake tastes light and fresh, never too sweet.</p>
    <p>A truly excellent recipe that always turns out fluffy and oh-so moist. Topped with the rich and delicious cream cheese frosting, this cake is truly the best ever. It was a handwritten recipe I found in my mom's recipe book, but I assume she found it elsewhere.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup pureed strawberries</li>
        <li>1/4 cupt 2% milk</li>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups sifted cake flour</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 packages (8 ounces) cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Grease and flour two 8-inch cake pans.</li>
        <li>Mix pureed strawberries, milk, eggs, and 1 tablespoon vanilla extract together in a small bowl; transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer.</li>
        <li>Beat flour, white sugar, baking powder, and salt into strawberry mixture on Low; add butter and continue beating on Low until evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Stop mixer, scrape sides, and beat again for about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Divide batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool the cakes in the pans for about 10 minutes; transfer to wire racks to completely cool, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Beat cream cheese and butter together in a medium bowl until smooth. Gradually beat confectioners' sugar into cream cheese mixture until creamy and fluffy; stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Spread about 1/2 the frosting on top of 1 cake. Place second cake on top of frosting layer; spread the remaining frosting on top of second cake and around sides of both cakes.</li>
    </ol>
