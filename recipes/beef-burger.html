    <p>The classic burger is an all time BBQ favourite! This super easy homemade beef burger recipe gives you delicious patties, packed with onions and herbs for extra flavour, that are perfect for topping with cheese, lettuce and tomato, and sandwiching between floury buns.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>500g pack British Beef Steak mince 15% fat</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mixed dried herbs</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>mature Cheddar slices</li>
        <li>4 white rolls</li>
        <li>few lettuce leaves, shredded</li>
        <li>1 beef tomato, slices</li>
        <li>Ketchup to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onion and cook for 5 minutes until softened and starting to turn golden. Set aside.</li>
